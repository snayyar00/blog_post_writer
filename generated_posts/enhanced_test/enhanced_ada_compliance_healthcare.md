# Making Healthcare Websites Accessible: A Fun Guide to ADA Compliance

## ADA Compliance: The Lowdown
We all love the Internet, don't we? It's like a global marketplace, library, and social club, all packed into one. But what if you couldn't enjoy it just because a website wasn't designed with your needs in mind? That's where ADA compliance steps in. It’s like a superhero ensuring everyone, including folks with disabilities, can access online platforms with ease. Now, that's what we call a win-win situation!

## ADA Compliance: What's That?
Back in 1990, the good folks of the USA passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). It mandated that public places should roll out the welcome mat for people with disabilities. Initially, it was all about physical spaces. But, with the birth of the digital era, websites got an invite to the party as well.

So, when we speak about **ADA Compliance for websites**, we're talking about designing your site so it's easy peasy for everyone to use. Whether someone's dealing with visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities, your site should be as welcoming as a warm hug.

Imagine not being able to access your favorite website. Now, that's a bummer, right? That's what people with disabilities experience daily. 

Making your website ADA compliant is like throwing open your digital doors to everyone. You expand your audience, show how inclusive your brand is, and build goodwill. Sounds like a good deal, doesn't it?
