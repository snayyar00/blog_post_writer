  "content": "# Your Handy Guide to E-Commerce Web Accessibility\n\n**Quick Recap**: Welcoming everyone to your e-commerce site is not just the right thing to do, it's smart for business too. Let\u2019s dive into this friendly guide that unpacks web accessibility, gives some super practical tips and explains how it can pump up your SEO and user friendliness.\n\n---\n\n## What on Earth is 'Web Accessibility'?\n\nLet's face it - we've all encountered a site that's like trying to find your way through a maze... in the dark. Web accessibility is the superhero that saves the day, making digital spaces like websites are super user-friendly, easy to navigate, and understandable by everyone - even folks with disabilities. In the e-commerce world, we're talking about ensuring all shoppers, no matter their abilities, can browse, add to cart and checkout without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe good ol' World Wide Web Consortium (better known as W3C) set the gold standard with their Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Their goal? To make the web a more user-friendly place for us all.\n\n---\n\n## Why Should E-commerce Sites Care About Accessibility?\n\nSo, why should you bother about e-commerce accessibility? Let's break it down:\n\n * **Broaden your horizon**: Over a billion people worldwide live with a disability. That's a significant chunk of potential customers that you're missing out on if your site isn't accessible.\n * **A better design for all**: Accessible websites offer a more enjoyable user experience which can turn casual browsers into loyal customers.\n * **Avoiding trouble**: It's not only the right thing to do, but in the U.S., it's the law. Businesses are required to provide equal access to all individuals.\n\nSo, friend to friend, it's a wake-up call when a shocking **97.8% of homepages fail to meet WCAG 2 criteria**.\n\n---\n\n## How Can We Make E-Commerce Sites More Accessible?\n\nAlright - now that we know the importance, let's put on our capes and get to work!\n\n1. **Image alt text**: Visually impaired? No problem. Alt text can describe the image.\n2. **Keyboard navigation**: Not everyone can use a mouse, so make sure all functions are keyboard-friendly.\n3. **Easy to read content**: Keep it simple, clear and concise with visual aids like subheadings and bullet points.\n4. **Colors and contrasts**: Easy on the eye color schemes and high contrast between text and background are a must.\n5. **Forms and checkout process**: If it's easy to fill out and complete, customers will be racing to the checkout.\n\n---\n\n## Your Cheat Sheet to WCAG Compliance\n\nWCAG compliance might sound like a beast, but don't worry - we have your back. Here's how to start:\n\n1. **Know the rules**: Get friendly with WCAG 2.1 to understand how it can help your site.\n2. **Regular audits**: Just like check-ups at the doctor, regular audits help catch issues early.\n3. **Accessible code**: Teach your developers how to use code that promotes accessibility like ARIA landmarks.\n4. **Use tools**: There's a heap of tools and plugins that can lend a helping hand.\n5. **Make it part of the plan**: Accessibility isn't a once-off task, it needs to be part of your ongoing digital strategy.\n\n---\n\n## How Does Accessibility Boost SEO?\n\nYou might be surprised to hear this, but web accessibility and SEO are like two peas in a pod. Both focus on user experience, ensuring content is valuable, comprehensible, and accessible. More accessible practices, like using descriptive alt text for images, can turbocharge your SEO and user experience game!\n\n---\n\nTime to wrap things up, friend! Digital accessibility isn't just a task to tick off on your to-do list - it's the foundation of a thriving e-commerce business! So, let's make the web an easier and more inclusive place for everybody, shall we?",
