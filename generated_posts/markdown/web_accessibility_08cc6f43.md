## What on Earth is 'Web Accessibility'?

Let's face it - we've all encountered a site that's like trying to find your way through a maze... in the dark. Web accessibility is the superhero that saves the day, making digital spaces like websites are super user-friendly, easy to navigate, and understandable by everyone - even folks with disabilities.

## Why Should E-commerce Sites Care About Accessibility?

So, why should you bother about e-commerce accessibility? Let's break it down:

 * **Broaden your horizon**: Over a billion people worldwide live with a disability. That's a significant chunk of potential customers that you're missing out on if your site isn't accessible.
 * **A better design for all**: Accessible websites offer a more enjoyable user experience which can turn casual browsers into loyal customers.
 * **Avoiding trouble**: It's not only the right thing to do, but in the U.S., it's the law. Businesses are required to provide equal access to all individuals.
